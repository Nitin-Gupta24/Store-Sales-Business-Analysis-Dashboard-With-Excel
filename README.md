# Store-Sales-Business-Analysis-Dashboard-With-Excel
This project focuses on Store Sales based on a dataset with **240,001 rows**, which was cleaned and transformed using **Power Query**, reducing it to **20,001 rows** by following a **star schema model** in Excel. The data has been analyzed through **Pivot Tables, DAX, and Macros** to extract actionable insights. This dashboard helps understand customer behavior, sales performance, profitability trends, and store comparisons.

## Dataset Description :

* A Store dataset typically includes information about the products, customers, and sales associated with store. 
* The dataset contained **240,001 rows** .


## Tools Used :
* **Visualization With Microsoft Excel** :-

    * **Power Query**  : Used for data cleaning and transformation.
    * **Pivot Tables** : Employed to summarize and analyze the structured data.
    * **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** : Leveraged for complex calculations and to create calculated fields in the dashboard.
    
    * **Macros** : Used to automate data filtering and enhance dashboard interactivity.


**NOTE :-**

* **Used Star Schema Design for data modeling** : 
  * A star schema was implemented to separate fact and dimension tables, making it easier to perform aggregations and ensuring faster querying. This schema enhances the efficiency of the analysis by simplifying data relationships between fact and dimension tables, improving dashboard performance and clarity.
  * By Following Star Schema , the dataset size was reduced from 240,001 rows to 20,001 rows with the help of Power Query, making it more manageable for analysis.
